# How To: Make a Virtual Camera for Windows

## Introduction

We've all lived through the pandemic and seen ourselves on camera and wondered "I wonder if I can do something with that"

Whether you are a tech-artist, engineer, or whomever. This is how you can make a **Userland** virtual webcam in code for **Windows**.

**Userland** means that you don't need to write and "real" or "kernel-mode" drivers. If you don't know what that means, no worries. It just means you don't need special permissions from the OS or special knowledge of how to talk to the guts of the OS.

I dug through the documentation so you don't have to!

## Setup

This project uses CMAKE, and since it's using the Windows SDK and API, it will need the MSVC toolchain. Sorry.
